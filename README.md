# Waterfall Charts using E-Charts

The data is provided by an open API provided to me by Alphaa AI

The charts are plotted using the library apache echarts. This is a single page application

The homepage looks like:

Along with the charts, there is a Summary box on the left side provided to generalize the summary of the data represented in the chart!

Thank you for the opportunity <a href="https://www.alphaa.ai/" target="blank">Alphaa AI</a>
